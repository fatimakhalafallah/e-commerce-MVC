# ECommerce
E-Commerce Website built for an e-commerce university class, using ASP.Net MVC, and SQL Server Database connected through Entity Framework Code First.

## Description
The final practial evaluation for our e-commerce class was to build a fully functional e-commerce webpage. As we did not have much time, we decided to build it through Code First Entity Framework so that the project could be faster to implement and we could focus more on design rather than worry about the data structure. For the project to be great on the front end we researched other websites to understand the necessary requirements and we applied the best ideas we saw fit. One of our primary concerns was to have a multi-language platform. Our native language Portuguese is not well known and English is fundamental for any platform to survive. We used images from other websites, as this platform wasn't meant to be used as it was only for a class project and we did not have time to create a catalog of products.
